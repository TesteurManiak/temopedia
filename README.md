Mobile app companion for the game [Temtem](https://crema.gg/games/temtem/) to get an easy access to creature's information using [Mael's API](#credits).

I am not affiliated with Temtem's company. This is a personal project I'm doing on my free time.

**This project is under refactoring. Everything might not work as expected.**

There is no release on the AppStore yet.
To test the application you need to clone and build the souce code, [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/) is required to do so.

``` bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/G_Roux/temopedia.git
cd temopedia/
flutter build ios
flutter install
```
